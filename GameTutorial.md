## Technical Integration

### Routes

- `/tutorial` - Main tutorial page
- `/tutorial/:lesson` - Individual lesson replay

### Home Page Updates

**Current form improvement:**

```html
<!-- Replace existing form with better styling -->
<div class="home-actions">
  <button class="btn btn-primary btn-large" onclick="location.href='/tutorial'">
    ðŸŽ“ Start Tutorial
  </button>
  <form id="lobbyForm" class="lobby-form">
    <input name="lobbyName" placeholder="Enter lobby name" />
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary">Play Now â†’</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

**First-time visitor prompt:**

- Check `localStorage.getItem('tutorial-prompted')`
- Show one-time toast: "New to Fog of War? Try the tutorial!"
- Set `localStorage.setItem('tutorial-prompted', 'true')`

### Progress Tracking

**localStorage keys:**

- `tutorial-completed`: boolean
- `tutorial-current-lesson`: number (1-12)
- `tutorial-lessons-completed`: array of completed lesson numbers
- `tutorial-prompted`: boolean (one-time home page prompt)

### Visual Components

**Tutorial Overlay System:**

```javascript
class TutorialOverlay {
  showMessage(text, options = {}) {
    // Display message box with text
    // Options: position, arrow, highlight, dim
  }

  highlightElement(selector, pulse = true) {
    // Add pulsing golden border
  }

  showArrow(fromX, fromY, toX, toY) {
    // Animated arrow overlay
  }

  dimBackground(exceptSelectors = []) {
    // Darken everything except specified elements
  }

  showProgressBar(current, total) {
    // Progress: Lesson X of 12
  }
}
```

**Tutorial Game State:**

```javascript
class TutorialGame {
  constructor(lessonNumber) {
    this.frozen = true; // Can pause time
    this.allowedActions = ["click"]; // Restrict what player can do
    this.lessonNumber = lessonNumber;
    this.setupLesson();
  }

  setupLesson() {
    // Configure map, bots, structures for this lesson
  }

  checkCompletion() {
    // Verify lesson objectives met
  }
}
```

### Success Celebration

**Confetti System** (reuse from konami.js):

```javascript
// On tutorial completion
confetti({
  particleCount: 100,
  spread: 70,
  origin: { y: 0.6 },
});
showToast("Tutorial Complete! You're ready to play!", "success", 5000);
localStorage.setItem("tutorial-completed", "true");
```

## Open Questions for Implementation

1. Should we create a new tutorial-specific bot class that's intentionally weak?
2. Do we need a tutorial-specific map generator for consistent lesson layouts?
3. Should confetti use canvas overlay or DOM elements?
4. How detailed should arrow overlays be (simple SVG or animated)?
5. Should we add voice narration option for accessibility?
